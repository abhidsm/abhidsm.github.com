  Our company is started following Xtreme Programming very seriously
  from last month. And there is a good result we are getting. Actually
  our company is doing Agile Development process from its
  beginning. But now we started following the Xtreme Programming
  process very strictly.

  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile
    Development</a>
  <br /><br />
  It is a group of software development methodologies based on
    iterative and incremental development. In Agile Development we
    break the tasks in to small increments with minimal planning, and
    we don't do long-term planning. We will do requirement analysis,
    design, coding, unit testing and acceptance testing in each
    iteration and will demo the working product to the customers. This
    will reduce the risk and allows the product to adapt to changes
    quickly. Extreme Programming is one of
    the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#Agile_methods">Agile
    Methods</a>.

  There are many processes included in Extreme Programming, which are
    all ensure the improvement in software quality and responsiveness
    to changing customer requirements. These processes are: pair
    programming, TDD, Iteration planning, Iteration demo,
    Retrospective meeting, etc. We are exactly following the processes
    from the book '<a href="http://jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/">The Art
    of Agile Development</a>' by James Shore.
