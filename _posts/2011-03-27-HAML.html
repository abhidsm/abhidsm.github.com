<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
  In our company we started using HAML for Web app development. HAML is very useful in creating web pages. We can replace the HTML tags with intended HAML representations.
  <br /><br />
  For example the HTML code:
  <br /><br />
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/1298789.js?file=sample_html.html"></script>
  <br />
  is represented in HAML as:
  <br /><br />
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/1298797.js?file=corresponding_haml.haml"></script>
  <br />
  In HAML indentation is very important. Otherwise it will show some error. There is a web app which converts HTML to HAML which is <a href="http://html2haml.heroku.com/">HTML2HAML</a>.
  <br /><br />
  For using HAML with rails you have to install the gem <a href="http://haml-lang.com/download.html">haml</a>.
  <br /><br />
  Now with HAML the lines of code we are writing became less and also
  because indentation is must the code became more cleaner.
