description: Setup Android Development Environment

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
  <div style="text-align: justify;">In my
    previous post I mentioned that I created a web application for
    Flames Game. So I was thinking about anything I can add to it
    apart from some new feature. Suddenly I got an idea to create an
    Android app. Actually I don't have any experience in Android app
    creation, but I have experience in Mobile app development with
    iPhone IOS and PhoneGap. The feature of PhoneGap is that it is a
    cross mobile framework. So I thought of developing Android app for
    FlamesGame using PhoneGap.

  <br />
  First I had to setup the development environment for Android. There is a good
  documentation in the Android website (<a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">Android Setup
    Documentation</a>) which directs you to install/setup the
  environment. So I just mention what I did for the
  setup:
  <br /><br/>
  <ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li>Downloaded JDK</li>
    <li>Setup the PATH variables for JAVA</li>
    <li>Downloaded Android and unzip</li>
    <li>Downloaded Eclipse and unzip</li>
    <li><a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html#installing">Installed
    and configured the ADT plugin for Eclipse</a></li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <div>Then I created a new Android application by the guidance of <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/projects/projects-eclipse.html">this
      document</a>. But I faced some <b>issues</b> while developing the app.
  </div>
  <div>
    <ol style="text-align: left;">
      <li><b>Create an AVD</b>: I was not able to create the AVD because while
        creating a new AVD it will ask for the target device, and it
        was a select box with empty option. Then I googled and found
        that I have to download the target Android API from the
        'Available packages' section just below the 'virtual
        devices'. After installing those packages, I created the
        AVD.
      </li>
      <li><b>Change Android Emulator Languag</b>e: The
        default language for the emulator was Chinese. I changed the
        language from the emulator itself by going to settings -&gt;
        Language &amp; Keyboard and check the Android Keyboard
        option.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <div>Now I have a FlamesGame App for Android. So I tried to publish this app to the Android
      Market. But for publish a Android app you have register as a
      Android developer. So I uploaded the Android app for FlamesGame
      to the <a href="http://flamesgame.appspot.com/">FlamesGame
        site</a>.
