  After I got some idea about Google App Engine, I was in a hunt for
  the idea to create an app using Google App Engine. I already decided
  to create app in Python, because Python is new to me and I want to
  learn Python &amp; Django. Then I remembered that 1 year before I
  created a J2ME application for my mobile which will calculate the
  relation between two people using their names.
  <br /><br />
  Then I started learning Python and Django, and released the first
  version in 2 days. You can check out the Flames Game
  app <a href="http://flamesgame.appspot.com/">here</a>. And I
  uploaded the source to the GitHub. You can check the source
  code <a href="http://github.com/abhidsm/flamesgame">here</a>.
