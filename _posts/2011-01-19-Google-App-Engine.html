You can download the SDK from <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html">here</a>.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Google App Engine gives you maximum of 10 accounts or domains. You can create 10 applications. It will add '.appspot.com' to your selected app name. And there is some limits in the usage of the resources.
