<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">In my company we started following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">pomodoro technique</a> last week.<br /><br />We are using pomodoro technique in pair programming. We switch the role(Navigator, Driver) between pair using this technique. &nbsp;We are using the timer-applet as the pomodoro device, which we set to 25 minutes. After the 25 minute the pair will discuss about the task and next steps to taken care off in the next 5 minutes. Then switch their roles and again start the timer.<br /><br />This helps to time-box each task. And helps to analyse the task is going in the right direction. And discussing about the task in each 25 minutes make the task more clear.<br /><br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9083125189194739371-9144957129121876367?l=abhidsm.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
