  In my company we started
  following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">pomodoro
    technique</a> last week.
  <br /><br />We are using pomodoro technique in pair programming. We
  switch the role(Navigator, Driver) between pair using this
  technique. We are using the timer-applet as the pomodoro
  device, which we set to 25 minutes. After the 25 minute the pair
  will discuss about the task and next steps to taken care off in the
  next 5 minutes. Then switch their roles and again start the timer.
  <br /><br />
  This helps to time-box each task. And helps to analyse the task is
  going in the right direction. And discussing about the task in each
  25 minutes make the task more clear.
