<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I had a plan to add analytics to <a href="http://flamesgame.appspot.com/">FlamesGame</a>. But what anlytics? number of users, region, or something else, I got confused. At last I decided to show the percent of results the users are getting.<br /><br />Then I started searching for any open source application or public API which provides or create chart. And I got <b>Google Chart</b>. Google provides a <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart/image/docs/chart_wizard.html">chart wizard</a>, using that you can customize your chart. You just need to pass the data to the Google chart API and it will return the chart as an image.<br /><br />Finally I implemented the <a href="http://flamesgame.appspot.com/analytics">Analytics</a> using Google chart.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9083125189194739371-3259125927876941252?l=abhidsm.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
