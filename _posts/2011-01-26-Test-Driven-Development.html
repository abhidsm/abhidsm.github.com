  TDD is a software development process, where the programmer first
  write the automated tests for the feature and makes it fail (RED)
  then write the code for the feature and makes it pass (GREEN) then
  re-factor the code.
  <br />
  There are many tests frameworks are
  available. <a href="http://www.nunit.org/">NUnit</a> for
  .NET, <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a> for
  Java, <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> for Ruby on
  Rails, <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html">unittest</a>
  for Python, etc.
  <br /><br />
  TDD makes the code more maintainable. The other person who is going
  to work on the code won't feel any fear to touch the code because if
  anything went wrong the tests will fail and he can find it
  quickly. TDD makes the programmer more focused. At a time he write
  code only to fix the the test fails.
  <br /><br />
  There are two approaches in TDD: Outside-In approach and Inside-Out
  approach.
  <br /><br />
  Outside-In approach is, first we write tests for the high level
  acceptance of the feature. To support this test there might be some
  tests which are very low level. So we write tests from High level to
  low level, and fix the failing tests from low level to high
  level. Once the High level test is passed you are done with the
  entire tests for that feature.
  <br /><br />
  In Inside-Out approach we write test for the low level task of the
  feature. After writing tests for all the low level tasks and makes
  it pass, we will write tests for the high level or acceptance
  scenario.
